This mod adds a check box that allows the player to show or hide the settlement/garrison faction flag.

[h1]Why?[/h1]
Because the faction flag covers part of the settlement/garrison panel, it gets in the way when hovering over buildings and makes it impossible to tell what garrison units hide behind the flag.
You can of course still tell which garrison composition the settlement houses by reading the settlement building descriptions but that kind of defeats the purpose of the garrison overview in my opinion.

[h1]Is this mod save-game compatible?[/h1]
Save to remove: Yes
Save to add mid-campaign: Yes

[h1]Is it compatible with ... ?[/h1]
Should be compatible with pretty much every mod out there.

[h1]Is this mod multiplayer compatible?[/h1]
Yes.
